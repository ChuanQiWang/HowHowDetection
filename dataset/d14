電子業低迷，有人說不知道未來要做什麼？談軟硬結合，有很多人邯鄲學步、亂畫大餅...舉例來說，這是很是適合台灣晶片設計產業提昇、轉型來做的題目：「Hardware and Algorithms for Learning On-a-chip」[註1傳統晶片設計的作法是不夠力的，需要能夠跨領域的團隊。有能力跨領域的話，研究題目和商機多的是... 但是，先找齊人才再說吧。In recent years, there have been enormous advances in implementing machine learning algorithms with application-specific hardware (e.g., FPGA, ASIC, etc.). There is a timely need to map the latest learningalgorithms to physical hardware, in order to achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance, energy efficiency and compactness. Recent progress in computational neurosciences and nanoelectronictechnology, such as resistive memory devices, will further help shed light on future hardware-software platforms for learning on-a-chip.In this context, a holistic approach of concurrent innovations in hardware and algorithms is essential to support real-time information analytics under stringent power constraints in a mobile system. The overarching goal of this special issue is to explore the potential of on-chip machine learning, to reveal emerging algorithms and design needs, and to promote novel applications for learning.The key topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:• Hardware acceleration for machine learning• Deep learning with high speed and high power efficiency• Hierarchical learning and classification on a chip• Hardware implementation of sparse coding, feature extraction and personalization• Hardware and computation models of the cortical and sensory systems• Nanoelectronic devices, circuits and architectures for neuromorphic computing• Emerging applications of on-chip learning, including mobile computing, automotive vision, etc.
